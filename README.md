# Hi_Low_py
Hi, Low is the number game where the user tries to guess the number that a computer picks. 

This game is coded in Python version 3.7.2

Psuedo Code: 
1. Terminal greets user and asks to play the game 
2. User is allowed to pick between 'y' or 'n' only. Anything else is not accepted
3. If user chooses 'N' exit, If 'Y' play the game.
4. The game opens by setting computers number for the round.
5. Amount of lives and turns are set for the game.
6. User is asked to pick a number between 1 and 100
7. After user guesses, the game checks for a match, greater than, or less than and returns a message depending on result. 
8. After 10 losses or a victory the user is asked to play again. 
9. Repeat 2 - 8 untill user decides to exit the game. 


The Game_file currently contains all the code the game uses. 
I would enjoy any feedback on how I can improve and in what ways. Thank you.
